// linear search is a one of the popular searching algorithm

// linear search is used to  search the element in unsorted array

// time complexity of linear search is O(n)  n => is a length of the array


//arr[1,2,45,7,5,45,35];

// you search the element 35 your loop will go through the end of the loop it is a worst case O(n) ;

// otherwise you search the element 1 it is the best case of linear search so it is a constant time O(n);
